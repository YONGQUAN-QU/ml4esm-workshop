title: Machine Learning for Earth System Modeling
---
---


# Call for papers

We are currently accepting submissions of short papers investigating machine learning techniques with the potential to advance earth system modelling. Topics include but are not limited to:

- hybrid physics-ML climate modelling
- full model emulation for weather and climate
- differentiable climate modelling
- dynamical downscaling
- uncertainty quantification
- anomaly detection
- parameter estimation for climate models

The deadline for all submissions is June 17, 2024 (AOE).

# Submission requirements

Papers must be 4 pages long, and author names must be omitted prior to submission. Submissions must clearly articulate applications relevant to earth system modelling. Accepted papers will be invited to give poster presentations, and a total of six will be invited to give spotlight talks. 

# Review Process

The review process for this workshop is double-blind, and we are accumulating a pool of reviewers with relevant expertise.
